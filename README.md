# **olc::PixelGameEngine Sample Structure**

## A fully set up project structure with debug and release commands for VSCode

All you need to do is clone this repo and start coding.
Be sure to change this readme and remove the `.gitignore` files in the build folders. They're only there because github likes to ignore empty folders.
I try to keep the olc::PGE header file updated with the latest release but it isn't guaranteed to be the case.
It's best if you use your own copy.

## Dependencies

[olc::PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
> Only the header file `olcPixelGameEngine.h` is required. Place it into the `include` folder.

TODO: add the g++ compiler toolchain and em++ as a dependency
